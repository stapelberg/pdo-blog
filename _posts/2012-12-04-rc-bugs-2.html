<p>
I recently worked on the following RC bugs:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/689769">#689769 — ample: ships a /var/run/ample folder: Policy 9.3.2</a><br>
Uploaded a patched version to DELAYED/5.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/694810">#694810 — plib: CVE-2012-4552</a><br>
Provided a patch, asked for instructions from the security team.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/694972">#694972 — imposm: missing source for imposm/cache/kc.c</a><br>
Uploaded a repackaged version to DELAYED/5.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/672926">#672926 — oidentd: Missing dependency on net-tools</a><br>
Uploaded another version which fixes my mistake of shipping changes to debian/
as a patch and hopefully gets an unblock.
</li>

</ul>
</p>
