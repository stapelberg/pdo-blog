title: "Talk about Debian Code Search"
---
<p>
At this year’s <a href="http://gulas.ch/">GPN13</a> I gave a talk about Debian
Code Search. It was in German, so I spent a few hours creating english
subtitles.
</p>

<p>
Get the video at <a
href="http://ftp.ccc.de/events/gpn/gpn13/gpn13-debian-code-search.mp4">http://ftp.ccc.de/events/gpn/gpn13/gpn13-debian-code-search.mp4</a>
(84 MiB) and the corresponding subtitle file at <a
href="http://t.zekjur.net/gpn13-debian-code-search.srt">http://t.zekjur.net/gpn13-debian-code-search.srt</a>.
Drop both files in the same directory, run <code>mplayer
gpn13-debian-code-search.mp4</code> and press v to enable subtitles.
I intend to eventually put the (subtitled) video on YouTube and refer to it
from <a href="http://codesearch.debian.net/">codesearch.debian.net</a>, but I
wanted to post the video in its current form already.

The presentation itself explains the motivation behind Debian Code Search and
how it works. You don’t need any knowledge of the system in order to understand
the talk. Enjoy!
