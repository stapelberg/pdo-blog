title: "WIT in Debian"
---
<p>
I just uploaded wit-2.10a to Debian experimental (it has to pass the NEW queue
first, though).
</p>

<p>
WIT (Wiimms ISO Tools) is a set of command-line tools to manipulate Wii and
GameCube ISO images and WBFS containers. It is useful (for me) to store backups
of my Wii games on a USB hard disk drive. This saves me the optical disc
juggling, doesnâ€™t wear off the discs as fast and gives faster load times.

<p>
Here is an example session where I format one partition of the USB hard disk
with WBFS and then copy my old WBFS image over to it:

$ wwt format -v --force /dev/sde3
