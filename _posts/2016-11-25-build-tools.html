title: "Debian package build tools"
---

<p>
Personally, I find the packaging tools which are available in Debian
<strong>far too complex</strong>. To better understand the options we have, I
created a diagram of tools which are frequently used, only covering the build
step (i.e. no post-build quality assurance checks or packaging-time helpers):

<p>
When I was first introduced to Debian packaging, people recommended I use
<code>pbuilder</code>. Given how complex the toolchain is in the pbuilder case,
I don’t understand why that is (was?) a common recommendation.
</p>

<p>
Back in August 2015, so well over a year ago, I switched to
<code>sbuild</code>, motivated by how much simpler it was to implement <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg//2015/10/12/ratt.html">ratt
(rebuilds reverse build dependencies)</a> using sbuild, and I have not looked
back.
</p>

<p>
Are there people who do not use sbuild for reasons other than familiarity? If
so, please let me know, I’d like to understand.
</p>

<p>
I also made a version of the diagram above, colored by the programming
languages in which the tools are implemented. The chosen colors are heavily
biased :-).

<p>
To me, the diagram above means: if you want to make substantial changes to the
Debian build tool infrastructure, you need to become an expert in all of
Python, Perl, Bash, C and Make. I know that this is not true for every change,
but it still irks me that there might be changes for which it is required.
</p>

<p>
I propose to eliminate complexity in Debian by deprecating the pbuilder
toolchain in favor of sbuild.
