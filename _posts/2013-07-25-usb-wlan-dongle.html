title: "Looking for a USB WLAN stick"
---
<p>
Posting this on behalf of a friend of mine in the hope that you can help:
</p>

<p>
I’ve failed several times now to find a suitable WLAN USB dongle that works out
of the box on Debian testing. Often manufacturers change the chipsets without
changing the version numbers, the product pages are incomplete or even state
wrong information.
</p>

<p>
I turn to you, in the hopes that someone can give me helpful pointers. The
dongle should have:
</p>
<ul>
<li>USB Dongle, i.e. no external router and the like</li>
<li>5 GHz support and 802.11n (“agn”)</li>
<li>work nicely on Debian testing (non-free is okay, but ndiswrapper or manually building modules isn’t)</li>
<li>available in Europe/Germany</li>
</ul>
 
<p>
If you have any hints, please send them directly to breunig AT uni-hd DOT de. Thanks!
