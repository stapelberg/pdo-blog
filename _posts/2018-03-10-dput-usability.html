title: "dput usability changes"
---

<p>
  dput-ng â‰¥ 1.16 contains two usability changes which make uploading easier:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    When no arguments are specified, dput-ng auto-selects the most recent .changes file (with confirmation).
  </li>
  <li>
    Instead of erroring out when detecting an unsigned .changes file, <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/devscripts/debsign.1">debsign(1)</a> is invoked to sign the .changes file before proceeding.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  With these changes, after building a package, you just need to
  type <code>dput</code> (in the correct directory of course) to sign and upload
  it.
