title: "dh-golang in unstable"
---
<p>
Good news, everyone! <a
href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/d/dh-golang.html">dh-golang</a> is now in
Debian unstable. With this debhelper addon, packaging software written in <a
href="http://www.golang.org/">Go</a> is very simple.
</p>

<p>
Have a look at <a
href="http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=collab-maint/dh-golang.git;a=tree;f=example">the
example/ directory</a> in dh-golang to see how it is meant to be used.
Essentially, export the DH_GOPKG variable containing the canonical upstream
location of the package (e.g. <a
href="https://github.com/stapelberg/godebiancontrol">github.com/stapelberg/godebiancontrol</a>)
and then use <code>dh $@ --buildsystem=golang --with=golang</code>. That’s it!
</p>

<p>
Now, given that this package is very new and only two packages use it so far
(both of which are not yet in Debian, but real soon™), there are most likely
bugs and missing features. This is where you come in: when packaging software
written in Go, please contact me and tell me whether dh-golang worked for you
and what could be improved. In case something does not work, definitely report
it. Even if everything worked, I’d be happy to have a look at your packaging
before you upload.
