title: "rc bug #694670: kscd does not play any CD"
---
<p>
Dear Lazyweb,
</p>

<p>
I recently investigated <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=694670">#694670 - kscd
does not play any CD</a> — essentially, at least on my machine, phonon-based
applications such as kscd won’t play Audio CDs when your CD drive is not called
<code>/dev/cdrom</code>, but e.g. <code>/dev/cdrom5</code> because I have had
multiple CD drives connected to my machine.
</p>

<p>
Now, I am not very deeply involved into KDE or phonon in particular. Therefore,
I am asking: Is there anyone who could have a look into this issue? It should
be easy to reproduce, you can simply append "5" to "cdrom" in
<code>/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rules</code> and reboot afterwards.
</p>

<p>
As an outsider, I am somewhat baffled by the complexity of C++, phonon,
gstreamer, etc. All these layers of abstraction are not that easy to debug, at
least not for me. Good blog posts about digging into this issue are appreciated
:-).
