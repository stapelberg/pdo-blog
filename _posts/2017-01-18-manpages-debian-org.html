title: "manpages.debian.org has been modernized"
---

<p>
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org">https://manpages.debian.org</a> has been
modernized! We have just launched a major update to our manpage repository.
What used to be served via a CGI script is now a statically generated website,
and therefore blazingly fast.
</p>

<p>
While we were at it, we have restructured the paths so that we can serve all
manpages, even those whose name conflicts with other binary packages (e.g.
crontab(5) from cron, bcron or systemd-cron). Don’t worry: the old URLs are
redirected correctly.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the design of the site has been updated and now includes
navigation panels that allow quick access to the manpage in other Debian
versions, other binary packages, other sections and other languages. Speaking
of languages, the site serves manpages in all their available languages and
respects your browser’s language when redirecting or following a
cross-reference.
</p>

<p>
Much like the Debian package tracker, manpages.debian.org includes packages
from Debian oldstable, oldstable-backports, stable, stable-backports, testing
and unstable. New manpages should make their way onto manpages.debian.org
within a few hours.
</p>

<p>
The generator program (“debiman”) is open source and can be found at <a

In case you would like to use it to run a similar manpage repository (or
convert your existing manpage repository to it), we’d love to help you out;
just send an email to stapelberg AT debian DOT org.
