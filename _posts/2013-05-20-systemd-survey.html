title: "Debian systemd survey"
---
<p>
In the past, we have had multiple heated discussions involving
systemd. We (the pkg-systemd-maintainers team) would like to better
understand why some people dislike systemd.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, we have created a survey, which you can find at
<a href="http://survey.zekjur.net/index.php/391182">http://survey.zekjur.net/index.php/391182</a>
</p>

<p>
Please only submit your feedback to the survey and not this thread, we
are not particularly interested in yet another systemd discussion at
this point.
</p>

<p>
The deadline for participating in that survey is 7 days from now, that
is 2013-05-26 23:59:00 UTC.
</p>

<p>
Please participate only if you consider yourself an active member of the
Debian community (for example participating in the debian-devel mailing
list, maintaining packages, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Of course, we will publish the results after the survey ends.
</p>

<p>
Thanks!
</p>

<p>
Best regards,<br>
the Debian systemd maintainers
