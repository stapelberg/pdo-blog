title: "systemd 44-5 available"
---
<p>
mbiebl has recently uploaded systemd 44-5 to Debian unstable. If you are
already using systemd, you should definitely upgrade to this version, it <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/s/systemd/systemd_44-5/changelog">fixes
a lot of little annoyances</a>. This is especially important if you are using
libvirt &gt;= 0.10.2-4 or if you experienced a hanging boot when your network
cable is attached.
